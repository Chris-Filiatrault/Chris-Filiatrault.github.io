### React source code
React source code written in JSX can be found inside the src folderr. 
JSX allows for writing JavaScript inside HTML.
This can be used to add logic to markup files to, for instance, create reusable components and avoid repetition of HTML code.

### Website source code
JSX code is compiled into (unreadable) browser-compatible JavaScript during deployment, which can be found in the gh-pages branch.
